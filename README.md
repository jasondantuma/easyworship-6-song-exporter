# EasyWorship 6 Song Exporter
A Simple song exporter for EasyWorship 6. Exports songs to rich text format (.rtf) with full text formatting from EasyWorship 6.

An experiment in Scala.

Makes use of [SQLJet](http://sqljet.com/) for SQLite database functionality.

##What do I need?
All you need is a recent version of [Java](java.com), and you shouldn't have trouble running the exporter.

##EasyWorship 2009 Support
Exporting songs from EasyWorship 2009 is not supported due to a different database format.

If you need to export from EW2009, grab the EasyWorship 6 trial and convert your database (it won't alter you EW2009 database).

Then use this exporter to export your songs.

##There's a bug!
Cool! Just to to the [Issues](github.com/jasondantuma/easyworship-6-song-exporter/issues) page and see if someone else has submitted the same issue. If not just create one.
